NEWS for rsm package

Changes in version 2.06 (18 April 2014)
  * Fixed a bug in contour.lm wherein if xlabs is supplied,
    decoding was disabled
  * Additional messages from contour.lm for misspecified axis labels.

Changes in version 2.05 (14 April 2014)

  * Added back some details (e.g. R^2, F) earlier omitted from 
    summary.


Changes in version 2.04 (5 February 2014)

  * Correction in bbd: Wrong design was generated when k = 6


Changes in version 2.03 (21 February 2013)

  * Corrected error in slice labels present since 2.00
    (Thanks AGAIN go to Keith Ponting, Avaya)


Changes in version 2.02 (9 February 2013)

  * Corrected deparse bug that occurs when model formula wraps a line.
    (Thanks go to Keith Ponting, Avaya)


Changes in version 2.01 (29 December 2012)

  * Added .ccd.1.41 and .bbd.141 functions, so that given the random seed, 
    one can reproduce a design that was generated in version 1.41 or earlier
    with the identical randomization. These functions are NOT exported.

  * Renamed 'join' to 'djoin' to avoid clashing with 'join' function in 
    the package conf.design

  * coded.data and as.coded.data generate automatic codings if no formulas 
    are provided.



Changes in version 2.00 (7 December 2012)

This is a major update of 'rsm'. It includes more pervasive and complete integration
of coded.data, and improves flexibility in generating designs and RSM analysis.

  * Old coded.data objects created before this version may need to be updated 
    (via as.coded.data) in order to use some new functions such as join

  * Allows more general rsm models, e.g. 
        FO(x1,x2,x3,x4) + TWI(formula = ~x1:(x2+x3+x4)) + PQ(x1,x3)

  * Can deal with singular second-order effects (e.g. stationary ridge). New threshold
    option in canonical analysis to actually force singularity -- which likely will
    identify a stationary point nearer the design center.

  * All design-generating functions ALWAYS create coded.data objects, and they
    have columns for run.order and std.order. There are additional (under the hood)
    enhancements to coded.data to keep track of primary variables, blocks, etc.

  * New cube(), star(), foldover(), dupe(), and join() functions for creating and
    combining designs. These should usually be used in preference to ccd() when
    doing iterative response-surface experimentation

  * Added a oneblock argument to ccd() so we can create an un-blocked CCD

  * A star block may be added to ANY design, including ones imported from other
    packages. Options alpha = "orthogonal" and alpha = "rotatable" calculate the
    the design moments, check suitability and set alpha to meet the criterion, or
    raise an error condition if it cannot be met.

  * New 'block' argument in coded-data-generating functions. May be needed to
    identify blocking factor(s). 

  * New varfcn() function for examining the scaled variance function for a design

  * contour.lm, persp.lm, image.lm now have "decode" argument (TRUE by default) 
    that displays decoded values on the coordinate axes when codings are available

  * contour.lm et al. now average over any factor levels rather than picking the
    first level of each. (May still specify particular levels in 'at')

  * New vignette with a simulated example of a series of response-surface experiments

  * Fixed some scoping bugs so that rsm can be called within a function. (This should
    make it possible to retire the spotRsm function in the SPOT package)

  * parse.coding function replaced by .parse.coding (and not exported)

  * row.names attribute for a design is updated to 1:nrow(design) every time it is
    randomized. 'ccd' does not create the same weird row names that it used to

  * print.coded.data now has argument to decide whether to show coded values or 
    actual values (actual is the default)

  * function "codings<-" to change the codings

  * function "[.coded.data" implemented for smarter handling of subsetted data;
    for example, if a coded column is excluded, so is its coding.

  * New functions "names<-.coded.data", "truenames.coded.data", "truenames<-.coded.data"
    for smart handling of variable names, keeping coding consistent with names

  * xs() function to obtain stationary point of an rsm object

  * TWI() function now has optional 'formula' argument to aid in specifying
    reduced version of second-order models


Changes in version 1.41 (July 28, 2012)

  * Added a NAMESPACE so it will work in newer versions of R
  

Changes in version 1.40 (July 28, 2010)

  * Fixed scoping bugs in 'model.data' (affects 'contour.lm' etc.)
  
  * Fixed scoping bugs in 'rsm'
  
  * Fix to 'rsm' -- coding worked incorrectly when 'data' keyword
    was not given explicitly.  Side effect: 'data' is no longer a 
    separate argument, it's just part of '...'
  
  * Added 'inscribed' optional argument to 'ccd'
    (Thanks to Ron Behlinger for suggesting this)
  
  * 'contour.lm' checks to ensure that elements of 'at' and 'bounds',
    if provided, are named.
  
  * New 'atlab' argument in 'contour.lm' and related functions.
    Now by default, the 'at' values are displayed for variables not on
    the coordinate axes; 'atlab' specifies where this information is
    shown, or suppresses it.
  

Changes in version 1.31 (December 19, 2009)

  * Fixed logic bug in contour.lm - didn't handle xlabs correctly


Changes in version 1.30 (December 16, 2009)

  * Enhanced contour.lm with hooks and improved axis labeling
    Also changed default to image=FALSE -- seems more "pure"
  
  * Added persp.lm for perspective plots akin to contour.lm
  
  * Added image.lm for image-only plots akin to contour.lm
  
  * Added 'codings' methods for coded.data and rsm objects
  
  * Added 'canonical' method for rsm for more convenient access
  
  * Updated references to 3rd ed. of Myers, Montgomery, Anderson-Cook
    (also corrected misspelling of Myers -- my apologies to Ray.)
  
  * Additional vignette "rsm-plots" describing contour, image, persp
    in more detail


Changes in version 1.21 (October 30, 2009)

  * Bug fix in contour.lm (axis labeling was reversed whern image=FALSE)
    Thanks to Eduard Sturm for reporting this
  

Changes in version 1.20 (October 20, 2009)

  * Replaced citation to point to paper published in JSS
  
  * Replaced vignette by JSS article


Changes in version 1.13 (12 October, 2009)

  * Fixed one misused macro in documentation


Changes in version 1.12 (5 May, 2009)

  * Modified CITATION file to conform to standards


Changes in version 1.11 (6 March, 2009)

  * Changed last variable name to 'logSD' in 'heli' and clarified 
    documentation for that dataset
    
  * Fixed bug in contour.lm relating to original use of model formula,
    e.g. it now works with for model fitted by 'lm(swiss)'


Changes from version 1.10 (30 December, 2008)

  * Added functions ccd() and bbd() for generating RS designs
  
  * Added function ccd.pick() to help in choosing good CCDs
  
  * Added checks in rsm() for aliased parameters

  * Added NEWS and CITATION files.
  
  * Tweaks/corrections/additions to documentation and vignettes.
  

Changes from version 1.01 (5 December 2008)

  * Added canonical.path function
  
  * Modified formula handling in coded.data and relatives so that any
    legal expression will work (as long as it's linear!)
  
  * Overhauled contour.lm, with different argument list.  Now it is much 
    easier to use, and can produce multiple plots with one call.
    
  * Provided a true vignette.  Other improvements to documentation.
