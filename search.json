(fact, decoded units, estimated optimum calls negative amount sugar!) best bet now experiment path leads us vaguely toward distant stationary point.","code":"expt5 = star(expt4, n0 = 2, alpha = \"orthogonal\") par(mfrow=c(1,2)) comb = djoin(expt3, expt4, expt5) varfcn(comb, ~ Block + SO(x1,x2,x3), main = \"Further augmented\") varfcn(comb, ~ Block + SO(x1,x2,x3), contour = TRUE, main = \"2nd order\") expt5 ##   run.order std.order    flour     sugar    butter rating ## 1         1         4 1.250000 0.5914214 0.2500000   26.0 ## 2         2         2 1.391421 0.4500000 0.2500000   23.9 ## 3         3         6 1.250000 0.4500000 0.3914214   27.6 ## 4         4         7 1.250000 0.4500000 0.2500000   26.7 ## 5         5         1 1.108579 0.4500000 0.2500000   26.7 ## 6         6         5 1.250000 0.4500000 0.1085786   27.3 ## 7         7         3 1.250000 0.3085786 0.2500000   29.3 ## 8         8         8 1.250000 0.4500000 0.2500000   27.4 ##  ## Data are stored in coded form using these coding formulas ... ## x1 ~ (flour - 1.25)/0.1 ## x2 ~ (sugar - 0.45)/0.1 ## x3 ~ (butter - 0.25)/0.1 anal5 = rsm(rating ~ Block + SO(x1,x2,x3), data = djoin(expt3, expt4, expt5)) summary(anal5) ##  ## Call: ## rsm(formula = rating ~ Block + SO(x1, x2, x3), data = djoin(expt3,  ##     expt4, expt5)) ##  ##                Estimate  Std.

Everything put coded scale, cube portion design values -1 1 variable, center points 0. ccd function creates entire CCD design; however, practice, often start just cube portion build . Therefore, functions cube, star, dupe, foldover provided, one may use djoin combine . cube ccd, basis argument determines basic design used create cube blocks. example, cube(basis = ~ + B + C) generate basic design 8 factorial points plus center points. Use generators want additional variables fractional design; example, generators = c(D ~ -*B, E ~ B*C) added generate 5-factor design defining relation = -ABD = BCE = -ACDE.  convenience, basis may integer instead formula, case default variable names x1, x2, ... used; example, cube(3, ~ -x1*x2*x3) generates 1/2 fraction design added center points. want cube points divided fractional blocks, give formula(s) blockgen argument cube, blocks argument ccd.  instance, suppose call cube(basis = +B+C+D+E, generators = F~-*C*D). design 32 runs; adding argument blockgen = c(\"*B*C\",\"C*D*E\") create fractional block 32/4 = 8 runs.

Therefore also convenient way re-randomize design. coding provided, coding formulas replaced well – example, re-center design. Use star generate star (axis) points, consist center points plus points +/- alpha coordinate axis.  may specify alpha want, character argument specify certain criterion met.  example, using delayed evaluation, ccd1 = djoin(cube1, star(alpha=\"sph\")) return CCD cube1 cube block, axis points distance corners cube.
