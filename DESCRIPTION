Authors@R: c(person("Russell", "Lenth", role = c("aut", "cre"), 
    email = "russell-lenth@uiowa.edu"))
Description: Provides functions to generate response-surface designs, 
    fit first- and second-order response-surface models, 
    make surface plots, obtain the path of steepest ascent, 
    and do canonical analysis. A good reference on these methods 
    is Chapter 10 of Wu, C-F J and Hamada, M (2009) 
    "Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Parameter Design Optimization"
